# Waiter Caller 

This project focuses on:
* Integrating bootstrap with Flask
* Using MongoDB with Flask
* Creating a User Account Control system from scratch
* Best password storage practices
* Mitigation against CSRF vulnerability

Note that, the focus is on education and building things from scratch instead of blindly using pre-existing frameworks. This code should not be taken as an example of production-ready code.
