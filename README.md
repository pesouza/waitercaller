# Waiter Caller 

This is the third and final example project from my book Flask By Example (https://flaskbyexample.com)

This project focuses on:
* Integrating bootstrap with Flask
* Using MongoDB with Flask
* Creating a User Account Control system from scratch
* Best password storage practices
* Mitigation against CSRF vulnerability
* Using the bit.ly API

Note that, as with the previous projects, the focus is on education and building things from scratch instead of using blindly using pre-existing frameworks. This code should not be taken as an example of production-ready code.
